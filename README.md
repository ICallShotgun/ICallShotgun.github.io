# Introduction:

Since the transition from religion to science as humanity's main epistemological methodology for establishing the "truths" of reality, humans have obsessed over the idea of scientific categorization and compartmentalization of the world. While there is much to be said for the efficiency that the movement brings in organizing objects into groups based on relationships or patterns observed, there is also a degree of ruthlessness in the ongoing attempt to quantify it all. On one hand, quantification of the human language has allowed for the creation of the online world which has fundamentally changed the efficiency and spread of human communication, commerce and cooperation. On the other hand, quantification of the human life has allowed for widespread discrimination to exist in a language that is often not accessible to the general public. While it is fairly easy to spot bias that exists in tests and their stated objectives, the same cannot be said for bias in algorithms as they, as well as their objectives, are not explicitly stated.

While much can be said about the wide and unregulated use of algorithms for the collection and processing of our lives as data, this article is interested in revealing the translation/adaptation of the resume by the applicant tracking system (ATS). Unbeknownst to most applicants to Fortune 500 companies, an estimated 95% of the companies utilize an ATS as the first set of eyes that look over a resume. (Augustine). This is significant for two reasons. First, there is a false assumption that in the transposition of the paper resume to a digital one that the document will still be read visually as if you were handing in your resume to a recruiter. Second, there is a false assumption that the written text will be translated in the way in which we draw meaning from the text. These are both important in understanding our bias in thinking these ways as well as what the ATS wizard is doing on the other side of the curtain.

# Historical Context: 

The inherent desire to have a standardized and universal method for arriving at a conclusion which can constitute a "truth" is not new, however, and has been the focal point of any epistemological view of the world. Epistemology refers to the study of knowledge by nature of its methods, scope and perceived validity. Historically, the dominant epistemology Western epistemology was Christianity and its methodology referred to ecclesiastical interpretation of its scriptures by church authority with regard to answering questions of the surrounding world. Those who did not obey the findings of the church, usually scientists, were subject to numerous punishments that ranged from excommunication (effectively a social "death") to imprisonment, torture and eventual death. An overhaul of the system came in the 19th-20th centuries as religious authority grew increasingly fractured and was eventually replaced by the more accepted belief in scientific authority. 

Perhaps unsurprisingly, one of the first focuses of the scientists in charge was to claim absolute authority in the creation of that which was truth and that which was not. The epistemology that won out on the authority to do so is known as "logical positivism." Although it has numerous facets to its "scripture," the most important one was a test which designated anything which could not be observed, measured, and quantified for mathematical proof, as "science." As "science" now had the authority to define what people should believe, the implications of failing the test can be equated to the censorship of excommunication. In a potentially inadvertent effect, many fields of science like psychology, which relied on subjective, qualitative analysis instead of "objective", quantitative analysis, were given the same inferiority of validity in their claims as was given to religion. Additionally, with the change in epistemology also came the change in dominant state ideology to that of scientism or the belief that the scientific method is the sole determiner of truth.

Scientism is perhaps most damaging for its application of scientific methods to realms that their scopes do not expand to (like religion). As well, as with any change in power, the linguistic terminology used to favor the new dominant system changed, equating "truth, rational, objective and quantitative" with credibility reserved for "science." Anything that is "not science" is therefore "false, irrational, subjective, and qualitative." Contrary to popular belief, religion is not the opposite of science despite their historical representation as foils to one another. Rather their relationship is a conflict of power while their belief systems depend on the same foundationalism fallacies of the Münchhausen trilemma which afflict every epistemology. Regardless of the rejection of logical positivism, the methodology along with some of its more damaging terminology associations still persist.

## Operational Definitions:

One such holdover of this methodology is the concept of operational definitions. Their original use was in the field of physics, a "hard science" and de-facto member of the "science" group, which needed a way to define its unobservable concepts so that they would not fall into the category of "belief." The solution was to measure a phenomena by proxy through relating the variable in question to other observable and empirically testable phenomena such as measuring lightyears in m/s. At best these were meant to serve as a placeholder for the variable with acknowledgement of its questionable validity as an indirect measure rather than a definitive one. Nonetheless, fields previously excommunicated from the sciences disregarded the questions of validity and rapidly began to deploy the method in quantifying its qualitative studies. Most notorious for this was the field of psychology as it began to popularize measurement of an individual's worth through abstractions like the IQ test as a measure of intelligence. 

## Artificial Intelligence/Machine Learning:

Computational linguistics, for the uninitiated, was a field originally started in the 1950's with the intention of using computers to translate text between different languages. Upon realizing limitations of resources and knowledge on hand, the field evolved into an intensive effort towards understanding how to represent and process natural languages with computers (NLP referring to Natural Language Processing in this article). As such, computational linguists working with en-US, the language code for specifying American English (whereas en-GB would refer to United Kingdom English), usually handle the creation of algorithms by teaching them American English rules of syntax and semantics. Syntax refers to the grammatical structure while semantics determine a value's meaning and relationships. For instance, couch flies lazily (subject verb adverb) is syntactically valid but semantically invalid. It is important to understand that valid syntax and semantics are not referring to the underlying programming language, like Python, that an algorithm might be coded in but rather how the algorithm reads and derives meaning from the American English language.

# The Text:

Despite the density of topics listed above, it is certainly not an exhaustive analysis of how we have ended up with our current application process. That being said, the information is to inspire dialogue for the reader by having them ask questions about the processes that they take for granted as objective evaluators of their worth. How much do you really know about what each piece of information you've included in your resume means to the employer?

This subject is of particular interest to me both as someone on the lookout for good employment opportunities as well as someone who spends a good amount of time arbitrarily deciding other's value as a contract recruiter. Since I spend so much time going through and critiquing others' resumes on the basis of what does or does not fit our abstractions of success, I thought it would be interesting to evaluate my own. However, unlike the ATS model, I do all of the sorting by hand and am very familiar with the bias that sets in after parsing, scoring and documenting candidates for hours on end. Additionally, ATS systems can also check to verify some of the information people put on their resumes which can help discourage those that try to game the system. 

Nonetheless, no matter how much I dislike systems that aim to label, categorize or abstract an individual's worth based on arbitrary measures of success, ATS models are not going anywhere any time soon. The best then that I can do is to try and shed light on the practices of the industry and to help those that might be unwittingly discriminated against by the syntax or the semantics they choose to represent themselves with.

# The Adaptation:

For my adaptation, I decided to translate my resume into the language that an ATS parses to determine whether or not it is a syntactically and semantically equivalent representation of myself in the new medium. I submitted a PDF of my resume to a PDF to text converter (.txt files are what most models look at because they remove "unnecessary code") located here: https://pdftotext.com/. The output, as shown below, should indicate that this adaptation is more of a commentary than a transposition.  

![Adaptation](/ATS_Text.jpg)
Figure 2: My resume after PDF to .txt conversion.

Just as I forfeited the agency in how my resume adapted to the new medium, like anyone who submits to an ATS does, the bias of my expectation versus reality becomes the topic of discussion. Adam Hammond does well to describe this reaction as his Literature in a Digital Age explains, "…digital editions can give us new access to analog originals and provide new experiences of print-entombed texts, but they never do so neutrally. Every digital edition is a translation, and as with all translations, each stands in a unique relationship - often ambivalent - to its analog original." (Hammond, 76). It is also worth mentioning that this conversion is the first step in the ATS process as then it proceeds to assess the semantics of the terminology the applicant used on the basis of the recruiter database of words to look for. The presence of keywords, the absence of keywords, the frequency of their use, how often they appear as phrases: all of these can be used to add or detract from the candidate's final score. Depending on whether the candidate passes the numeric threshold for consideration then determines which bin your resume ends up. In my case, it was likely the trash bin.

## Human Subjective Reading vs. Model "Objective" Reading: 

There are three main biases I notice for how I read my resume versus how the model reads it: file formatting bias, visual hierarchy bias and font bias.

I attribute file formatting bias to specifically what can be converted to .txt format. Given that an ATS can only interpret text, anything that is not text cannot be converted into a readable format in the .txt file. As it stands, ATS systems do best with resumes saved as a docx file while only some ATS models can handle PDFs. Despite its PDF format, my resume converted okay, however, in looking at my resume which has many non-text elements and comparing it against the adaptation, none of the colors, pictures, or icon replacements for bullet points are translated into the document. Depending on the modernity of each ATS model's conversion script, other omitted elements can include anything that is included in document headers/footers. While an omission is the best outcome in these scenarios, on the basis of the overall rhetoric of my resume, they are incredibly damaging because in their unintended creation of space or lack thereof in the output, I am losing out on the original argument that was there.

The visual hierarchy bias is similar to file formatting bias in that there is a disconnect between what we expect would happen for the decompiling of a file into text strings. This specifically relates to our creation of visual hierarchy by using grids and cells for how our resumes should be read. In my resume, for instance, the left most column is designed to catch reader attention at the top left corner with the image, like what would normally happen for English readers. However instead of continuing from left to right, then top to bottom, it directs the eyes down through the left hand, third of the page. Unfortunately, by reference of what actually occurs in the .txt output, the ATS does not detect the rows or columns in the grid and instead reads left to right, top to bottom. This is undoubtedly the biggest mistake as the text in the left hand column is randomly appended, out of context, to whatever the previous line in the right, two thirds of the document was discussing. This is especially damaging as not only does it turn the .txt file into a parsing nightmare but it turns the syntactic analysis of the grammar of my document into a series of false positives for someone who doesn't understand English. As most are likely aware, spelling and grammar issues are the quickest way to disqualify your resume from the applicant pool and my resume is no exception in this regard. 

The last model bias is probably one of the more ambiguous issues to contend with as one would assume that the text would output exactly as it currently looks in the text editor. There is no cue as to why it would do otherwise unless one is familiar with the complexities of decoding construction of fonts through pixel alignment and spacing. There are four types of fonts: serif, sans-serif, decorative, and script. ATS models are notorious for only interpreting serif and sans-serif fonts with unreadable fonts replaced with tofu (appears a series of squares). As can be seen by the serif font, Enriqueta, which I use for the body of my text, there is no issue with how it is translated into the .txt language standard of Calibri. Contrary to that, the heading text in the sans-serif font of Comfortaa translates in all caps and with spaces in between each of the letters. This is a big issue for people knowledgeable with parsing as unexpected spaces and capitals can throw off how the model determines the end of a sentence and thus can further compound issues of visual hierarchy bias. Essentially there is little expectation that my resume would retain its titles in extraction into the ATS documentation.

## Cultural Significance: 

More than likely the reader has experienced an application rejection from online submissions before. As this adaptation deals with just the preprocessing of a resume into a "readable" format, the significance of this text is limited to automatic rejections that may occur due to the conversion output. Unfortunately it is impossible to draw on the significance of that because the reason that someone was rejected is almost never shared with them, particularly if it is in relation to revealing a company's usage of an ATS. However these algorithms are not just limited to the job application industry, "Algorithms that may conceal hidden biases are already routinely used to make vital financial and legal decisions. Proprietary algorithms are used to decide, for instance, who gets a job interview, who gets granted parole, and who gets a loan" (Knight). While it may not be as impactful to receive unexplained rejections for jobs or college, these algorithms have spread across finance, healthcare, insurance, mortgages, loans, housing, etc. Rejections or high rates often go unexplained to applicants with inquiries stonewalled by fallacious appeals to algorithm authority and transparency demands deflected by claims of intellectual property.  

Although the artifact itself does not specifically cover post-processing, from my experience as a contract recruiter, I am intimately familiar with deriving meaning from abstract keywords as assumed measures of an individual's ability to perform well, amongst other things. Furthermore, I am intimately familiar with NLP dataset creation for AI training and am well aware of the biases that can leak in with regard to bad ontology setup or the presence of "edge cases" that can be one thing or the other. If that experience has taught me anything, it's that there is never a moment in which an algorithm becomes "good enough" as languages are constantly evolving, with their dialects and colloquialisms adapting to location and exposure to different cultures. For instance, in India alone there are 22 major languages with approximately 720 different dialects between them which is why we use language codes to specify localization requirements for jobs I run. Nonetheless, it is near impossible to authenticate someone as the particular labels we are looking for as even the descriptors that universities use to define their linguistics programs differ from country to country. As such, standardization of hiring terminology is far more an art than a science with any claims otherwise highly suspect to discriminatory practices.   
  
# Rhetorical Situation:

Hopefully the reader has had time to consider their own resume as a text with respect to the questions of algorithm reliability asked and explanations of industry practices given. Although this information can hardly be considered "liberating" due to the looming awareness of tests applied without one's consent, the intention is for the reader to scrutinize these processes rather than to just accept their results. Regulation of the spread of these arbitrarily derived labels and scores, which affect anything from our perceived reliability to our likelihood of getting a lower rate on a loan, is critical in ensuring the creation of a system that does not inherently favor one group over another.

![SAT Scores](/SAT.png)

(Figure 3: 1 of 4 charts from College Board detailing how SAT scores are directly tied to higher family financial and educational levels.

No matter how confident that one is in their creation of tests as a measure of specific objectives, it must be remembered that these can often result in unintended statistical correlations showcasing inherent biases present in their experimental process. Yaël Eisenstat, a former CIA officer trained in recognition of cognitive biases, talks specifically of a general corporate unpreparedness to adequately consider the ramifications of biased tests, "Companies such as Facebook—my former employer—Google, and Twitter have repeatedly come under attack for a variety of bias-laden algorithms…Humans cannot wholly avoid bias, as countless studies and publications have shown. Insisting otherwise is an intellectually dishonest and lazy response to a very real problem." (Eisenstat). As the reader considers more carefully as to how they might be discriminated against, it is also useful to consider how their actions in biased system creation might affect those around them as ability tests are not exclusive to algorithms. 

![Hybrid Resume](/Hybrid.jpg)

(Figure 4: Hybrid resume format recommended by Jobscan as the preferred resume format by both algorithms and recruiters alike. Image source = https://www.jobscan.co/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/hybrid-resume-template.jpg)

While it is useful to be able to identify ATS models for what they are, equally so it is useful to be able to identify when a test is infringing upon your right to equal and non-discriminatory hiring practices. Cathy O'Neil, a outspoken advocate of reining in unregulated algorithmic discrimination, decries corporate inclusion of pre-interview, personality tests as equally vague in their supposed objectives, stating, "defenders of the tests note that they feature lots of questions and that no single answer can disqualify an applicant. Certain patterns of answers, however, can and do disqualify them. And we do not know what those patterns are. We're not told what the tests are looking for. The process is entirely opaque" (O'Neil, 110). A recent ruling by the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission on personality tests "claimed that applicants were excluded from employment on a statistical basis because the tests used result in different scores based on the race and national origin of the applicants…if [the test] results in a disparate impact against women or minorities, the employer would need to demonstrate a business necessity behind use of the test that could not be accomplished through other means that would not result in this disparity" (Crotty). As tests grow more diverse, widespread and ambiguous, more than likely the regulation of their ethical implications will fall upon those subject to them to challenge the company to be transparent with their testing processes.

![Keywords List](/Keywords.png)

(Figure 5: Keywords comparison between job post and job specific resume. Image source = https://www.jobscan.co/blog/wp-content/uploads/skills-example-expanded.png)

After all, it is becoming more difficult for employers to duck accusations of rampant scientism when they refuse to be transparent on how precisely the absence of a specific word can predict unfavorable, future job performance. Especially as companies like Google and Amazon note that there is markedly no difference between those who have a college degree and those who do not in terms of the future rates of job success. We are rapidly approaching oversaturation in the hyper-credentialism that plagues America hiring practices.

# Reflection:

As I believe the reflection questions are important for context, I am leaving them in to inform the questions the reader might have about my answers.

* If someone outside this class (like your intended audience) actually viewed your artifact, what might they think of you (the artist). 

Intention is an interesting question for my piece as it varies between the source text (my resume) and its adaptation (ATS model's translation of my resume). As it stands, my resume is the only text that holds my intention showing the best representation of myself to my audience of potential employers. The ATS adaptation is a great example of "lost in translation" from the stripping of personality/individuality from my resume. The text is further distorted by the model's inability to reconstruct the resume into the proper syntactical structure which further alters the human reading of the piece. With the stripping of agency for applicants like myself to creatively communicate our intentions to an employer, I have instead switched the audience to others that may use the wrong language like I have.

* If you had abundant time and resources, what would you do differently for your adaptation?

If given more time and resources, I would love to embed an ATS in a webpage and have people submit their resumes in an attempt to beat the system. I think it would be interesting if I could encode feedback associated with failures determined by algorithmic parameters regarding the syntactical and semantical rules the system used to arrive at its decision. I think the biggest issue with any sort of test is a lack of transparency as to what the data means in its interpretation by the test parameters. It would be even more interesting to look at the cognitive biases that are encoded into the algorithm by nature of the systems ability to discriminate outside of the syntax necessary to parse the data. The main risk of trying to define membership of qualitative objects to any group is the decision that the model is close enough. Once that decision is made, the likelihood that the algorithm will undergo further revision to adapt to any sort of inherent bias is highly unlikely. Furthermore, the likelihood that the recruiters review the rejected resumes to make sure the system is not throwing out other qualified candidates drops to zero with respect to their confidence that the system has attained "human-level" judgement capabilities.

* In what situation outside of class/school might this project might be applicable and how so?

At this point, this question would belabor the point that this entire paper has been trying to put across to the reader. This paper exists to enlighten the reader to what "objectivity" means in regard to the recruiter's objective. In understanding this difference, the reader is better able to respond to the recruiter by making sure that their resume is written in the language that it is actually expected in. This cognizance is necessary for those who don't have the resources or the connections to get their tailored resume past the automated security. This paper is also a warning to the danger of giving any mathematical model the benefit of the doubt as they do not see that which they were not programmed to see.
